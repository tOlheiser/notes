# Algorithms & Data Structures

The resources I'm using to learn algorithms and data structures are as follows:
- Abiding by the approach outlined in this [reddit post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgktuv/the_definitive_way_on_how_to_leetcode_properly/)
- Pulling the LeetCode problems from this [repository](https://gist.github.com/tykurtz/3548a31f673588c05c89f9ca42067bc4) which organized the problems into different patterns.

## The Approach
1. Pick a pattern from the above repository.
2. Go through each problem in the pattern, and go **straight** to the solution without trying to solve it.
3. Understand the solution deeply. Make notes, watch videos, or look at the discussion section.
4. Repeat for each problem before you can move on to the next pattern.
